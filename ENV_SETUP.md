ENV setup

This repository includes an example environment file `.env.example`. To create and use a local `.env` file:

1. Copy the example to create a local `.env` file:

   cp .env.example .env

2. Edit `.env` and provide values where appropriate. For example, to edit with `nano`:

   nano .env

3. Do NOT commit secrets (API keys, passwords) to `.env` if you want them to remain private. If you need to share secrets securely, use an encrypted secret manager or share them out-of-band.

4. If `.env` is tracked in this repo (it may be present on feature branches), be aware it will be visible in the repository history and on GitHub for those branches. To avoid tracking `.env`, add it to `.gitignore` and remove the tracked file using:

   git rm --cached .env
   git commit -m "Stop tracking .env"

5. If you need help syncing `.env` across machines or teams, ask the repository maintainer for a recommended approach.
